blurb: A simple platform for publishing metrics, both as JSON, and as embeddable visualisations that let you make a data-driven dashboard
---

Publish your organisations' metrics as open data, and build dashboards to display them.

Bothan is a simple metrics storage and visualisation tool. Amongst other things, it powers the [ODI dashboards](http://dashboards.theodi.org/). It provides a REST API for storing and retrieving time-series data, as well as human-readable views which can be customised and embedded in other sites, allowing it to be used for building dashboards. It is designed for open publication of metrics data and includes licensing metadata for simple generation of an [Open Data Certificate](https://certificates.theodi.org/).
