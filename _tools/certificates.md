blurb: The mark of quality and trust for open data
---

Prove the quality of your data publishing, and help build trust with your data reusers.

Open Data Certificate is an online assessment tool for open data releases. It allows publishers to assess how good their open data release is across technical, social, legal and other areas. When published, a certificate (which can be Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum) shows data reusers how much they can trust and rely on the dataset.
