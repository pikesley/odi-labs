blurb: Publish data easily, quickly and correctly
---

Take your first steps in open data publishing; publish quickly and easily, for free.

Octopub is an online tool that makes publishing open data simple. By uploading a single CSV file, and filling in 6 information boxes, a user can

* Publish their dataset online without any infrastructure cost (by using GitHub)
* Ensure the data is valid with [CSVlint](http://csvlint.io/)
* Prove that it is open data with an autogenerated [Open Data Certificate](https://certificates.theodi.org/)
* Give their users a human-readable view of the dataset and its data (generated using GitHub Pages).
* Enable bulk download of the dataset
* Enable API access to the data, using a structure auto-generated using the CSV on the Web standard.

Publishing is also integrated into [Comma Chameleon](http://comma-chameleon.io/), so that a desktop user can load in an excel file, clean it, and publish in a single process without needing to be an expert.
