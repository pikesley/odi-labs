blurb: Check your CSV files with CSVLint
---

Check that your CSV files are easy for reusers to consume, and conform to standards and schemas.

CSVlint is an online validation tool for CSV files. It validates conformity of CSV releases to standards, checks for missing or malformed data, and can validate against both CSVW and Datapackage schema standards. It is designed to act as a continuous validation service, so that when data is changed online, the validation is updated. Data can be online or uploaded for private validation.
